## Unused
* Better Rolls for 5e - reduces number of clicks when rolling combat. not really needed when using Beyond20
* Chat Damage Buttons, Beyond20 Edition - buttons in chat to deal damage/healing through Foundry character sheets
* DnDBeyond NPC Sheet - adds an additional NPC sheet. probably just uninstall this
* Dramatic Rolls - add sound effects to nat 20 or nat 1. if Confetti add-on installed, will use on nat 20
* Not Your Turn! - block token movement if not the token's turn
* Tabletop RPG music - free fantasy music!

## Consider Uninstalling
* Quick combat - tweaks to combat experience. playlist, rolling initiative
* Random Encounters - create random encounters for a scene. seems complicated
* Reset Movement - return combatant to where it was at the beginning of the turn

## Think About Installing
* Confetti - Adds confetti! can be triggered on Nat 20's w/Dramatic Rolls add-on
* Polyglot - what languages do your characters speak?
* Monk's Little Details - Quality of Life improvements, e.g. better status effects, scene compendium squashed view, others
* Simplefog - simple fog of war layer
* Multilevel Tokens - teleport/clone tokens between areas!!
* Lock View - lock what players can view
* Forien's Quest Log - Keep track of quests for the party

## Not Used Anymore
* Active Auras - propogate auras onto other tokens, e.g. Aura of Protection. works with Active Effects. Tied to using FVTT character sheets to be effective
* DnD5e Helpers - a bunch of little things, mostly tied to FVTT character sheet usage. Actively maintained
* Torchlight - TorchLight HUD controls. I like Torch a tiny bit better, but this still has potential

## Figure out these ones...
* DAE (dynamic active effects)
* DAE w/SRD
* FXMaster (weather effects to map!)
* Compendium Folders
* Compendium Image Mapper
* NPC Chatter
* Expander
* Jinker's Animated Art
* Midi QOL - auto-targets tokens in a spell's template
* Monk's Little Details
* Not Your Turn
* Torch
* Turn Marker - is Combat Ready a better option?

## Look into installing
* Bellows - how well does it work for playlists?
* token action HUD(?) or something like that...
* popout resizer!
* critter DB import - import homebrew monsters?
* legend keeper importer - keep notes in legend keeper website?
* maestro
* easy target - target tokens with alt-click
* the furnace
* token info icons
* MESS spell effects
* token aura
* trigger happy... maybe
* let me roll that for you - works w/Midi QOL to let players roll their own saving throws (from foundry, not dndbeyond of course)

## Random notes
* table ninja shows up on player view?

## Module ideas
* look into modifying SoundBoard by Blitz to select multiple libraries/use from other installed modules w/audio
* custom view to tag your own modules for people who install a lot?
* mash-up Not Enough NPC's: a 5e NPC Generator w/tokens on imgur?
* webm preview in file browser

## Things to look into
* troubleshoot what modules are CPU intensive
* figure out targeting in combat
* cool roll tables for the jungle
  * automatically connect to tokens!
* blank/template battle map
* sounds!
  * go through sonniss stuff and categorize it for better soundboard
* campaign organization ideas for all scenes/actors/etc.
